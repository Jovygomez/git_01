## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

The sun was shining on the sea,    
Shining with all his might:    
He did his very best to make.   
The billows smooth and bright —    
And this was odd, because it was.   
The middle of the night.  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both. 
And be one traveler, long I stood. 
And looked down one as far as I could. 
To where it bent in the undergrowth;  
Then took the other, as just as fair,  
And having perhaps the better claim,  
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;  
Though as for that the passing there. 
Had worn them really about the same,  
And both that morning equally lay. 
In leaves no step had trodden black.  
Oh, I kept the first for another day!  
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,  
I doubted if I should ever come back.  
I shall be telling this with a sigh. 
Somewhere ages and ages hence:  
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—  
I took the one less traveled by,  
And that has made all the difference.

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
The sea was wet as wet could be,  
The sands were dry as dry.  
You could not see a cloud, because. 
No cloud was in the sky:  
No birds were flying overhead —  
There were no birds to fly.  

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
In the quiet woods where shadows play,  
The whispers of the wild hold sway.  
A river hums its timeless song,  
Guiding ancient echoes along.  

The trees, like sentinels, tall and wise,  
Stretch their arms to the velvet skies.  
The wind, a traveler, soft and free,  
Carries the scent of earth and sea.  

A fox slips through the silvered night,  
Eyes aglow in the pale moonlight.  
The owl, a guardian in the trees,  
Calls to the stars with haunting ease.  

Beneath the ferns, where secrets sleep,  
The forest holds its mysteries deep.  
The leaves, like pages, softly turn,  
As fires in distant skies still burn.  

Through the wild, life ebbs and flows,  
A dance that only nature knows.  
The pulse of time, both swift and slow,  
Guides the paths we dare to go.  

In the silence, one can find,  
The whisper of the earth’s great mind.  
A voice that speaks in rustling leaves,  
Of truths the heart alone perceives.  

So listen close, and you may hear,  
The ancient song that's always near.
