In the quiet woods where shadows play,  
The whispers of the wild hold sway.  
A river hums its timeless song,  
Guiding ancient echoes along.  

The trees, like sentinels, tall and wise,  
Stretch their arms to the velvet skies.  
The wind, a traveler, soft and free,  
Carries the scent of earth and sea.  

A fox slips through the silvered night,  
Eyes aglow in the pale moonlight.  
The owl, a guardian in the trees,  
Calls to the stars with haunting ease.  

Beneath the ferns, where secrets sleep,  
The forest holds its mysteries deep.  
The leaves, like pages, softly turn,  
As fires in distant skies still burn.  

Through the wild, life ebbs and flows,  
A dance that only nature knows.  
The pulse of time, both swift and slow,  
Guides the paths we dare to go.  

In the silence, one can find,  
The whisper of the earthâ€™s great mind.  
A voice that speaks in rustling leaves,  
Of truths the heart alone perceives.  

So listen close, and you may hear,  
The ancient song that's always near.
